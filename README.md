### Stroke-Prediction-ML-Project
I have taken this dataset from kaggle.com 
I perform EDA using Pandas, seaborn, matplotlib library
In this I used machine learning algorithms for categorical output like, logistic regression, Decision tree, Random forest, KNN, Adaboost, gradientboost, xgboost with and without hyperpameter tunning
I concluded, the best model as RANDOM FOREST with best accuracy
